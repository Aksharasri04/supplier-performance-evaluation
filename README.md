## Motivation 
Use geospatial analytics and machine learning to evaluate supplier performance and delivery risk so businesses can choose reliable suppliers, predict delays, and optimize shipment decisions (mode, routes, costs). Your research questions cover risk clustering, distance vs. delay, shipment mode effects, Incoterms, order size, and regional patterns.
